The E-Library System is a web-based application built using Java Servlets, 
JSP, and JavaBeans, designed to simplify online library management. It 
enables two types of users(Librarians and Members) 
to perform tasks such as registering, logging in, managing books, and 
borrowing available books. The system stores data persistently using an 
Apache Derby (JavaDB) database, developed and run via NetBeans IDE with 
GlassFish Server.
